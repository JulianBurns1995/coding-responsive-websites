            Hi. I'm Julian
          </header>
          <main>
            There was a time when I was unmotivated, and convinced that things couldn't get any better. I was certain that I was
			stuck in a life where I hated myself and everyone else. But that has changed, and that old version of myself has died.
			The old Julian would have told you he was disappointed that it took 24 years and hours of procrastination and time wasting
			to kill him. But the new Julian embraces life in the Nietzschean sense without apology and enjoys it as it deserves to be enjoyed.
			Even the memories of empty hours watching television.

                People love to talk about themselves, which I'm sure is useful to incorporate into a project. Get people to
                talk about themselves and suddenly they are very interested. But is narcissism always a bad thing?

                <p>Its not that we can let our egos take over but rather that there is virtue in being compassionate towards your

                <p>I used to hate those around me but now I realize that the people who were nastiest or most deluded probably suffered
				more than I did before I realized that suffering towards a goal was the meaning of life.</p>
